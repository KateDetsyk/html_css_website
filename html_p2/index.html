                The main parts of our element are: 
                <br><br><strong>The opening tag</strong>: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the start of the paragraph is.
                <br><br><strong>The closing tag</strong>: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the end of the paragraph is. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error and can lead to strange results.
                <br><br><strong>The content</strong>: This is the content of the element, which in this case is just text.
                <br><br><strong>The element</strong>: The opening tag plus the closing tag plus the content equals the element.
            </p>
