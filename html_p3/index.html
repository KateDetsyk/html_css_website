                As an example, in a story the <strong>h1</strong> element would represent the title of the story, <strong>h2</strong> elements would represent the title of each chapter, <strong>h3</strong> elements would represent sub-sections of each chapter, and so on.
            <br><br>
                It's really up to you what exactly the elements involved represent, as long as the hierarchy makes sense. You just need to bear in mind a few best practices as you create such structures:

<br> - Preferably you should just use a single <strong>h1</strong> per page — this is the top level heading, and all others sit below this in the hierarchy.
<br> - Make sure you use the headings in the correct order in the hierarchy. Don't use <strong>h3</strong> elements to represent subheadings, followed by <strong>h2</strong> elements to represent sub-subheadings — that doesn't make sense and will lead to weird results.
<br> - Of the six heading levels available, you should aim to use no more than three per page, unless you feel it is necessary. Documents with many levels (i.e., a deep heading hierarchy) become unwieldy and difficult to navigate. On such occasions, it is advisable to spread the content over multiple pages if possible.
