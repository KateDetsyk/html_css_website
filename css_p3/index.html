            <h3>How does CSS actually work?</h3>
            <p><br>
                When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's 
                content with its style information. It processes the document in a 
                number of stages, which we've listed below. Bear in mind that this is 
                a very simplified version of what happens when a browser loads a 
                webpage, and that different browsers will handle the process in 
                different ways. But this is roughly what happens.
                <br><br>
                1. The browser loads the HTML (e.g. receives it from the network).
                <br><br>2. It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model). T
                he DOM represents the document in the computer's memory. The DOM is 
                explained in a bit more detail in the next section.
                <br><br>3. The browser then fetches most of the resources that are 
                linked to by the HTML document, such as embedded images and videos ... 
                and linked CSS! JavaScript is handled a bit later on in the process, 
                and we won't talk about it here to keep things simpler.
                <br><br>4. The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different 
                rules by their selector types into different "buckets", e.g. element, 
                class, ID, and so on. Based on the selectors it finds, it works out 
                which rules should be applied to which nodes in the DOM, and attaches 
                style to them as required (this intermediate step is called a render 
                tree).
                <br><br>5. The render tree is laid out in the structure it should 
                appear in after the rules have been applied to it.
                <br><br>6. The visual display of the page is shown on the screen 
                (this stage is called painting).
                <br><br>7. The following diagram also offers a simple view of the 
                process.

            <h4>About the DOM</h4>
            <p>
                <br>
                A DOM has a tree-like structure. Each element, attribute, and piece of 
                text in the markup language becomes a DOM node in the tree structure. 
                The nodes are defined by their relationship to other DOM nodes. Some 
                elements are parents of child nodes, and child nodes have siblings.
                <br>Understanding the DOM helps you design, debug and maintain your CSS
                 because the DOM is where your CSS and the document's content meet up. 
                 When you start working with browser DevTools you will be navigating 
                 the DOM as you select items in order to see which rules apply.
            </p>
            <h5>A real DOM representation</h5>
            <p>
                <br>
                Rather than a long, boring explanation, let's look at an example to see how
                 a real HTML snippet is converted into a DOM.
                <br>Take the following HTML code:
            </p>
            <img class="ex1"src="css_p3/pic1.png" alt="Example 1">
            <p>
                <br>
                In the DOM, the node corresponding to our p element is a parent. Its 
                children are a text node and the three nodes corresponding to our span 
                elements. The SPAN nodes are also parents, with text nodes as their children:
            
            </p>
            <img class="ex2"src="css_p3/pic2.png" alt="Example 1">
            <h6>What happens if a browser encounters CSS it doesn't understand?</h6>
            <p>
                <br>
                The answer is that it does nothing, and just moves on to the next bit of CSS!

<br><br>If a browser is parsing your rules, and encounters a property or value that it doesn't understand, it ignores it and moves on to the next declaration. It will do this if you have made an error and misspelled a property or value, or if the property or value is just too new and the browser doesn't yet support it.

<br><br>Similarly, if a browser encounters a selector that it doesn't understand, it will just ignore the whole rule and move on to the next one.
