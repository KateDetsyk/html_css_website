            <h3>Selectors</h3>
            <p>
                <br>You can't talk about CSS without meeting selectors, and we have 
                already discovered several different types in the Getting started with
                 CSS tutorial. A selector is how we target something in our HTML 
                 document in order to apply styles to it. If your styles are not 
                 applying then it is likely that your selector does not match the
                  thing you think it should match.
                <br><br>Each CSS rule starts with a selector or a list of
                 selectors in order to tell the browser which element or elements the 
                 rules should apply to. All of the following are examples of valid 
                 selectors, or lists of selectors.
            </p>
            <img src="css_p2/pic1.png" alt="Example 1">
            <h4>Specificity</h4>
           <p>
            <br>There will often be scenarios where two selectors could select the same 
            HTML element. Consider the stylesheet below where I have a rule with a p 
            selector that will set paragraphs to blue, and also a class that will set 
            selected elements red.
            </p>
            <img class="ex2" src="css_p2/pic2.png" alt="Example 2">
            <p><br>Let's say that in our HTML document we have a paragraph with a class of 
                special. Both rules could apply, so which one wins? What color do you think 
                our paragraph will become?
            </p>
            <img class="ex3" src="css_p2/pic3.png" alt="Example 2">
            <p>
                <br>The CSS language has rules to control which rule will win in the event of a 
                collision — these are called cascade and specificity. In the below code block
                 we have defined two rules for the p selector, but the paragraph ends up 
                 being colored blue. This is because the declaration that sets it to blue 
                 appears later in the stylesheet, and later styles override earlier ones. 
                 This is the cascade in action.
            </p>
            <img class="ex4" src="css_p2/pic4.png" alt="Example 4">

            <p>
                <br>However, in the case of our earlier block with the class selector and the 
                element selector, the class will win, making the paragraph red — even though 
                it appears earlier in the stylesheet. A class is described as being more 
                specific, or having more specificity than the element selector, so it wins.
            </p>
            <h5>Properties and values</h5>
            <p>
                <br>
                At its most basic level, CSS consists of two building blocks:
                <br><br>
                <strong>Properties</strong>: Human-readable identifiers that indicate which 
                stylistic features (e.g. font-size, width, background-color) you want to 
                change.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Values</strong>: Each specified property is given a value, which 
                indicates how you want to change those stylistic features (e.g. what you 
                want to change the font, width or background color to.)
                <br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <h6>Functions</h6>
            <p>
                <br>
                While most values are relatively simple keywords or numeric values, there 
                are some possible values which take the form of a function. An example would
                 be the <strong>calc()</strong> function. This function allows you to do simple math from 
                 within your CSS, for example:
            </p>
            <img class="ex6" src="css_p2/pic6.png" alt="Example 4">
            <img class="ex5" src="css_p2/pic5.png" alt="Example 4">

            </div>
    </body>
